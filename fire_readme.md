###  Next steps and issues

-  dimensionless groups

-   things are converging with an error
  -  see `Stability : Things are slow to converge near the stability boundary`

-  `G_postfire(self)` does not need RI or severity.
      - Is this function defined in `fire_analytic.py`?

- how do results depend on the degree of correlation between layers?
